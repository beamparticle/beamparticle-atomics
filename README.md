# beamparticle-atomics
Repository of Atomics a.k.a functions inside beamparticle.

## Overview

This repository is home to all the functions which can be directly
fed into [beamparticle](https://github.com/beamparticle/beamparticle).

> The name *atomic* is sort of a misuse, but is primarily used to
> sound *cool* and relate to the original project is a somewhat
> meaningful manner.

## Objective

What better way to share functionality than git repository, where
contributors can add various functions directly usable by
[beamparticle](http://beamparticle.org). Additionally, this
repository can be loaded into beamparticle (*to be done*) with
simple command, so that anyone running a version of beamparticle
can easily import these functions easily.


Happy riding the [BEAM](http://erlang.org/faq/implementations.html) on
these beamparticle atomics!
